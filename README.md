# Simple Neural Networks

1.cpp the original file of the model

2.cpp needs to be combined with Python to map the results

3.cpp categorizes all vectors with one random matrix

4.cpp categorizes all vectors with one random matrix, records the number of vectors in each cycle as well as the distance of each vector to its cycle

5.cpp uses a random vector and a specific matrix (matrix 5.txt) to see the probability of state changes

6.cpp is modified from 5.cpp and incorporates random noise (not really used)

7.cpp is 3.cpp with extension
