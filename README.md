# Simple Neural Network

## Files

#### Old Models (Python)
* **1.py**
    * inputs: *None*
    * parameters: *N, probability of connection, timesteps*
    * outputs: *a graph that shows the end cylce of a random vector*

* **2.py**
    * new parameters: *number of trials*
    * new: *new random vector for each trial, cleaner code for each trial*
    * new outputs: *categorization of unique, transient, and repeating vectors for all vectors in all trials*

* **2_1.py**
    * new: *cleaner code for each trial*
\
\
#### Old Models (C++)
* **1.cpp**
    * new: *C++ version of 1.py*
        * new outputs: *timesteps, on neuron coordinates for graphing*


* **2.cpp**
    * new: *clearner code*
